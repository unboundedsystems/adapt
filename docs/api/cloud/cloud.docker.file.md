## docker.File interface

A dynamically-created file that can be used during the build of a Docker image.

<b>Signature:</b>

```typescript
export interface File 
```

## Properties

|  Property | Type | Description |
|  --- | --- | --- |
|  [contents](./cloud.docker.file.contents.md) | <code>Buffer &#124; string</code> | The contents of the file. |
|  [path](./cloud.docker.file.path.md) | <code>string</code> | The path in the temporary image where the file will be created. |

## Remarks

These `File` objects are used to create a temporary "scratch" image in a [multi-stage build](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/) that contains only the specified files. Then, in later stages of that build, the files within the temporary image can be copied into the later stage image.
